<ins>Title:</ins> Identifying RNA Motifs of Specific Families Using Machine Learning  

<ins>Abstract:</ins>  
  
- Motivation: In order to understand the functionality of genes and cell processes, identifying motif is very
important. Though there are some existing tools and research works for identifying motifs, but no tool
has been developed yet for identifying motif families based on their existing family patterns. Here, in this
research work, we have tried to develop a model which will be able to identify motifs belonging to known
motif families such as Kink-turn, Sarcin-ricin, Tandem-shear. For that, we have considered the sequential
and structural features of the motifs and explored both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms.  
- Results: Using supervised learning, we were able to achieve a high accuracy in predicting the family of a
motif while unsupervised learning have shown moderate performance. In conclusion, supervised learning
performs better in predicting motif families with an accuracy higher than 92%.
